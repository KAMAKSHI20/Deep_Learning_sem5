Deep learning is a subset of machine learning, which is essentially a neural network with three or more layers. These neural networks make an effort to mimic how the human brain functions, though they fall far short of being able to equal it, enabling it to "learn" from vast amounts of data. While a neural network with a single layer can still make approximations, extra hidden layers can serve to refine and optimize for precision.
